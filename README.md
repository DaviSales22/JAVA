# School Grade Validator (Java)


## Description

The School Grade Validator is a Java application that allows you to validate your school grades. It takes your individual subject grades as input and calculates if you have achieved at least 60% of the total points. Based on your performance, it provides personalized feedback.

## Features

- Input your subject grades and calculate your overall score.
- Determine if you have passed (achieved 60% or more) or failed.
- Receive custom feedback based on your performance.

## How to Use

Clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/DaviSales22/JavaValidationNotes
```
Depending on your performance, the School Grade Validator will provide one of the following feedback messages:

- **Congratulations:** If you have scored more than 60% of the total points, the program will congratulate you on passing the year.

- **Recovery Needed:** If you have not achieved 60% of the total points, the program will inform you that you need to recover your grades.

- **Points Needed for Recovery:** Along with the recovery message, the program will also tell you how many points you need to score in order to reach the passing threshold.
